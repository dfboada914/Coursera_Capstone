    "The problem is about a person who wants to buy a house in Toronto. So he needs to analyze the neighborhoods of the city to know which one has all the requirements that he needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly He needs a neighborhood where he can find at least 4 of the venues in the next categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar\n",
    "- Pharmacy\n",
    "- Gym\n",
    "- Bank\n",
    "- Coffee Shop\n",
    "- Restaurant\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is important because I can create a tool where the people can find their perfect Neighborhood using the Foursquare data. Most of the people care about not only the characteristics of an apartment or a house like number of bedrooms, mts, floor, etc... but they care about the neighbor to know what kind of places they are near for, or what kind of places they can go to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem I will use Python 3 and the Foursquare API to find the first 100 Venues from the neighborhoods of Toronto. Finally I will select the Neighborhoods to make a recommendation about where He can buy his new house. "
